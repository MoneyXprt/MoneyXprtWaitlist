## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in MoneyXprt, please **do not create a public GitHub issue**.  
Instead, report it responsibly:

- Email: security@moneyxprt.com (preferred)  
- Or use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing) feature if enabled.  

Please include as much detail as possible:  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Potential impact  
- Suggested fixes (if any)  

We aim to acknowledge reports within **48 hours** and provide a fix or mitigation within **14 days** (severity-dependent).

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing code, please:
- Avoid introducing dependencies with known vulnerabilities  
- Keep all packages up-to-date  
- Use environment variables for secrets (never commit keys to git)  
- Follow the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) guidelines

## Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with security researchers who disclose issues responsibly. Public disclosure of a vulnerability prior to a fix may put users at risk and is discouraged.
